To run the performance Monitor, enter the command "make all" while in the batchmark_makeflow_local directory.
  This will return graphs plotting the wall time, memory used, average number of cores, and MB read and written to disk.
Once you obtain the images of the graphs or any data needed, run the "make clean" command in the batchmark_makeflow_local directory. This will remove all the .dat, .sumamry, and
.png files located in the bathmark_makeflow_local directory.
